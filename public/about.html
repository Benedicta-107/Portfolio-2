<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Here's a revised summary:

  "As a detail-oriented and innovative software developer, I leverage my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native to craft exceptional mobile and website 
  applications. With a background in Rural Sociology and Agricultural Extension, I've developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I've successfully 
  applied to learning software development and also, demonstrating my ability to learn and adapt to new technologies." <br>
  I recently completed a comprehensive software development program with Stutern, an online platform, from September 2022 to December 2023. This experience has 
  equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in full-stack and mobile development. <br>
  I've successfully built multiple projects, including a food ordering app, clones of popular platforms like Instagram and Netflix, and a recipe page. Currently, 
  I am expanding my skills in web development through a U demy course taught by Dr Angela Yu, further solidifying my foundation in full-stack development. <br>
  I am excited to continue growing as a software developer, and I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of clients and users."
